## How to print it or export to PDF?

Printing the document is easy and you don't need to change anything to print it or export it to PDF.

You may use a tool of your choise to export the HTML to PDF, or use your web browser.

## Exporting with the web browser

3. On the combo box "Destination", select "Save as PDF" to export to PDF, or select your printer name to print it.
